# Astro161-Final
Final Project for Astro 161: Relativistic Astrophysics and Cosmology at UC Berkeley. In this project, my team developed a sample data lab assignment based upon our course's discussions of LIGO and gravitational waves. 

Please note that the code for this leture is greatly influenced from the tutorials from the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center, that can be found in the sources section of the lab document. Without their open source material, we would not have been able to complete this lab in its entirety.
